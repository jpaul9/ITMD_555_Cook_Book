# ITMD_555_Cook_Book
Final Project

Project Description*

This application will store a user’s favorite recipes which they’ve created, found and/or tried in one
location. Users can keep recipes in print version to scroll through or list version to easily check off
ingredients and steps whilst preparing a particular recipe. It will allow the user to search and find
recipes that they’ve saved/downloaded, favorited or created in the past. Users can also edit recipes
to include substitutions or personal adjustments to suit diet, budget or preference. The app also
allows users to share their recipes with others.

The app will be free but hopefully in the future it can be monetized through
minimal in app advertising.

We’re hoping to use/implement the following:
1. Use firebase for authentication of user sign in with Google or social networking credentials.
2. Use Google credentials to complete new user registration.
3. Use of Google Maps to route users to the nearest grocery store.
4. Use Google analytics to determine where our best users are located.
5. MyCookbook.io API allows users to create cookbooks of their favorite online recipes.

*-Based on what we're aiming for creating in and for our app not on what we've actually achieved.
